# Autotorch Mod

This is a fabric client mod which will help you place torches.

#### NOTE: [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) is needed for this mod to function.

## Usage

To use it, put torches in your offhand. It will then start automatically placing torches when the LightLevel of the block you are standing on is less than 4. It's that simple!

### Changing light level

You can change the light level at which the mod starts placing torches using the mod settings on Mod Menu. Or edit `.minecraft/config/autotorch.json` and change `lightLevel` to what you want

**NOTE: This is a client only mod. It wouldn't do anything on a server.**
